# MCP extension architecture (YOLOZU v2)

This document fixes the extension layering and operational policy.

## Layer design

1. Core layer (`yolozu.integrations.layers.core`)
   - request/response shaping
   - error normalization
   - short summary generation
2. YOLOZU API layer (`yolozu.integrations.layers.api`)
   - CLI/API wrapper execution
   - argument/path guards
   - allowlist enforcement
3. Job layer (`yolozu.integrations.layers.jobs`)
   - async execution with `job_id`
   - queue / running / completed / failed / cancelled tracking
4. Artifact layer (`yolozu.integrations.layers.artifacts`)
   - run listing/description
   - metadata (`git_sha`, `manifest_sha256`, runtime info)

## Tool roadmap status

Data entry tools (A1-A3) are implemented in shared backend `yolozu.integrations.tool_runner` and exposed via both MCP and Actions API:
- A1: `validate_predictions`
- A2: `validate_dataset`
- A3: `convert_dataset`

Inference tools (B4-B6) are implemented in the same shared backend and exposed via both MCP and Actions API:
- B4: `predict_images`
- B5: `parity_check`
- B6: `calibrate_predictions`

Evaluation tools (C7-C9) are implemented in the same shared backend and exposed via both MCP and Actions API:
- C7: `eval_coco`
- C8: `eval_instance_seg`
- C9: `eval_long_tail`

## Long-running jobs

Long tools should return quickly with `job_id`.
Job states are persisted under `runs/mcp_jobs/*.json` and restored on restart.
States restored as `queued`/`running` are converted to `unknown` to avoid false in-flight claims.

Current API surface:
- `jobs.list`
- `jobs.status(job_id)`
- `jobs.cancel(job_id)`
- `runs.list`
- `runs.describe(run_id)`

## Security policy

- Only allowlisted `yolozu` top-level subcommands are executable.
- Path traversal (`..`) is rejected.
- Absolute paths outside workspace are rejected.
- CLI execution has a timeout guard (default 600s).
- `stdout`/`stderr` are capped and marked with truncation metadata in response payloads.

## CI no-abandon rule

When MCP-related changes are pushed:
1. run local checks (`manifest`, unit tests)
2. push and monitor latest CI
3. if failure appears, patch and re-run immediately
