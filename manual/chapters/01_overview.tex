Introduce \yolozu{}'s contract-first evaluation idea, the repo entry points, and the two CLI surfaces (pip vs repo).

Helps you pick the right workflow quickly and prevents confusion about where artifacts and commands live.

No prerequisites beyond reading; use \cmd{--help} on the CLI you choose and treat JSON artifacts as the stable interface.

\section{What \yolozu{} is}
\yolozu{} is a \textbf{contract-first evaluation harness}.
The core idea is: \textit{run inference anywhere}, export a stable \path{predictions.json},
then evaluate consistently.

\section{AI-first design intent}
This repository is organized as an \textbf{AI-first} codebase.
In practice, that means:
\begin{itemize}
  \item AI agents should be able to \textbf{use} the code safely via stable command surfaces and contracts.
  \item AI agents should be able to \textbf{extend} workflows (new experiments, new scripts, new reports) without breaking interfaces.
  \item JSON schemas and machine-readable registries are treated as first-class interfaces, not optional metadata.
\end{itemize}

Operational guidance (used by both humans and agentic workflows): make artifacts first-class, validate contracts early, and keep evaluation protocols pinned.

Key goals (high-level):
\begin{itemize}
  \item Stable, versioned JSON artifacts (predictions, reports, run metadata).
  \item CPU-minimum development and tests; GPU is optional for training/inference.
  \item Backend-agnostic workflows (PyTorch / ONNX Runtime / TensorRT / custom C++/Rust).
  \item Easy migration: accept common dataset ecosystems (Ultralytics/YOLO, COCO JSON) via small wrapper artifacts, without modifying your original dataset.
  \item Production-oriented run contract for training (artifact paths, resume, export).
  \item Apache-2.0-only operational posture (no non-Apache dependencies in shipped code paths).
\end{itemize}

\section{How to navigate the repository}
The main entry points are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \path{README.md}: quick overview and a few canonical commands.
  \item \path{docs/README.md}: docs index organized by \textit{what you want to do}.
  \item \path{docs/yolozu_spec.md}: feature summary/spec.
  \item \path{tools/}: power-user scripts and the repository wrapper CLI.
\end{itemize}

\section{Two CLIs: pip vs repo}
\yolozu{} typically exposes two command surfaces:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{pip CLI}: \cmd{yolozu ...} (install-safe, user-facing commands)
  \item \textbf{repo CLI}: \cmd{python3 tools/yolozu.py ...} (research/eval workflows)
\end{itemize}

They share concepts and contracts. This manual uses whichever is most common for the workflow
being discussed.
