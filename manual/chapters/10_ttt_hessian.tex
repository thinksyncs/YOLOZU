\chapter{TTT (Test-time Training) and Hessian Solver}

\section{TTT: safe adaptation}
\yolozu{} includes support for controlled test-time training (TTT) flows.
The design goal is to make adaptation experiments safer by providing:
\begin{itemize}
  \item presets,
  \item guard rails,
  \item reset policies,
  \item predictable reporting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Hessian solver for regression refinement}
Certain tasks benefit from iteratively refining regression head outputs.
\yolozu{} provides a Gauss--Newton style refinement utility (Hessian-based) for regression heads
such as depth, rotation, and offsets.
