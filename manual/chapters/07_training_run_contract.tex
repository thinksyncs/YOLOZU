\chapter{Training and the Run Contract}

\section{RT-DETR pose training stack}
The repository includes an RT-DETR-based training pipeline under \path{rtdetr_pose/}.
The important property is not the exact model, but the \textbf{run contract}: stable artifact paths
and resumable runs.

\section{Run contract: why it matters}
A run directory typically contains:
\begin{itemize}
  \item checkpoints (e.g., \path{runs/<run-id>/checkpoints/best.pt}),
  \item exports (e.g., ONNX),
  \item predictions and evaluation reports,
  \item calibration stats artifacts (when enabled).
\end{itemize}

This makes it easy to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item reproduce results,
  \item run parity checks,
  \item compare across branches/machines.
\end{itemize}

\section{Smoke training}
A typical smoke entry point is exposed as a script under \path{tools/}.
The exact command may change; search for \path{smoke} scripts in \path{tools/}.
