"""RT-DETR pose scaffold package shim.

This repository stores the implementation under `rtdetr_pose/rtdetr_pose/`.
When installed as a wheel, that nested layout would normally expose modules as
`rtdetr_pose.rtdetr_pose.*`, which breaks imports like `rtdetr_pose.dataset`.

To keep the public import surface stable (`import rtdetr_pose.*`), this shim
extends the package search path to include the nested implementation directory.
